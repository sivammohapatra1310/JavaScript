JavaScript Framework
Definition: A JavaScript framework provides a structure for building applications, offering a collection of libraries, tools, and best practices to streamline development.
Example: React and Angular.
React: Provides components, state management, and lifecycle methods to build user interfaces.
Angular: A comprehensive framework with tools for building single-page applications, including dependency injection, data binding, and routing.


JavaScript Library
Definition: A JavaScript library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks, making development easier and faster.
Example: jQuery and Lodash.
jQuery: Simplifies DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests.
Lodash: Provides utility functions for common programming tasks, such as working with arrays, objects, and strings.


Browser APIs
Definition: Browser APIs are built into web browsers, allowing developers to interact with the browser and manipulate web pages.
Example: Document Object Model (DOM) API and Fetch API.
DOM API: Allows manipulation of HTML and CSS, e.g., document.querySelector() to select elements.
Fetch API: Enables making network requests, e.g., fetch('https://api.example.com/data') to retrieve data from a server.


Third-Party APIs
Definition: Third-party APIs are external services that provide functionality via an API, which developers can integrate into their applications.
Example: Google Maps API and Twitter API.
Google Maps API: Allows embedding maps, adding markers, and performing geolocation.
Twitter API: Provides access to Twitter data, such as retrieving tweets or posting new ones.


Summary of Differences
JavaScript Framework: Provides a complete structure and set of tools for building applications (e.g., Angular, React).
JavaScript Library: Offers a collection of functions and methods for specific tasks (e.g., jQuery, Lodash).
Browser APIs: Built-in browser functionalities for interacting with the web page and network (e.g., DOM API, Fetch API).
Third-Party APIs: External services providing additional features and data (e.g., Google Maps API, Twitter API).
